# SquirrelPAK 20ET - Expanded Technology

> Expanded Technology - We took Technology Arising then added a few mods like AE2, Extreme Reactors, Integrated Dynamics, and a few other for a Expanded Menu of Tech for your SquirrelCraft fun!

We took our SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising and though that there could be room for expansion. This squirrel feels like more tech is a good thing. So we expanded on our 20TA and created SquirrelPAK 20ET - Expanded Technology! Yet another PAK spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube
 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20ET - Expanded Technology is built upon our SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising PAK then we really expanded our tech mods with PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (by desht_08), more RFTools (Control & Storage), AE2 (Applied Energetics), Integrated Dynamics (by kroeser), Tetra (by mickelus) for your tool tech upgrades, Extreme Reactors (by ZeroNoRyouki) for more power options, added more options to the Create & RFTools mods, and finally the one that really expands this PAK, Thermal Expansion (by TeamCoFH). One of this squirrels favorites! For the full mod list in the pack check out the Mod Pack Deps page for up to date list.

This PAK is yet again another arrow in the really full quiver of our MC 1.20.1 PAKS. However it's still not the highest of Tech Mods... again thats soon to come stay tuned for more! But why so many tech PAKs? I wanted to give a range from Low, Med, and Highest of tech mods so you can choose how much tech heat you want to bring to your modded Minecraft adventure.
