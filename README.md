# SquirrelCraft 20AV - Almost Vanilla 

```
Hark, what is that sound!? That my fellow Squirrel is the sound of a new mod PAK dropping and hitting the CurseForge databanks! The time is here! SquirrelCraft's release of its first in a line of forge mod packs for 1.20 is here!
 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20AV - Almost Vanilla is just what is says. Like SquirrelPAK AV, It's Vanilla Minecraft with a dash of squirrels. That dash includes life improvement mods including JourneyMap, MouseTweaks, JEI, and others. Also included are mods that we here at SquirrelHQ think add a little extra that makes this pack "Almost Vanilla" including server and performance mods.
 
Because this PAK will be the base for more MC 1.20 PAKs to come we have included mods that allow for better server play and administration. For the full list of mods head to the Wiki.
 
The purpose of this PAK to set the ground work for more mod packs that are in the works that will be based off of this one like the 1.18 version. We tried to limit the mods that make changes to game play and addition of blocks to keep it as Vanilla as we could. Download SquirrelPAK 20AV today and once agan rock Minecraft like a Squirrel, AV style!
