# SquirrelPAK 20LT - Low Tech 

```
The Low Tech SquirrelCraft's release of its line of forge mod packs for 1.20 is here. Spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube
 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20LT - Low Tech is built on our SquirrelPAK 20VP - Almost Vanilla PAK but starts to add some low tech mods to the mix. Its not a high tech mod PAK but just enough tech to make it sparkle. Like the eyes of that squirrel that almost ran you off the road by running in front of you the other day. It bridges the gap between the super high tech mods and the vanilla and plus PAKS.
