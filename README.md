# SquirrelPAK 20ME - Medieval Everquesting 

'''

Spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube  This new PAK is EVIL, medieval that is!  In this release  SquirrelPAK 20ME - Medieval Everquesting is built on Almost Vanilla Plus PAK with a dash of knights, spells books, potions and medieval themed music and pictures for your walls.  Oh and did I mention the dragons mounts ? So gird your loins with your finest suit of armor, mount thy trusty steed, grab a lance and joust your way to the lost castle where your will find the end portal. Not before you must find the 12 unique eyes to open said portal to the end!  Even after you are feasting on dragons flesh from your victory over the end, you still have multi mods that add even more questing. From the foul smell of the Undergarden, to the dim lights of the Twilight Forest where you can actually find squirrels will keep you questing for days! If you have finished all of those quests then finds keys to the dimensional dungeons for never ending looting. Did I mention amazing music from the amazing artist Alexander Nakarada? 

 

We are sure if you like the days of old, of knights spells and questing then you will like SquirrelCraft's take with our SquirrelPAK 20ME - Medieval Everquesting.

 

Be sure to check out our Lets Play Series on YouTube  where this PAK was spawned from. We are going through 250 mods and will spin off more MOD packs in the months to come! And download out LP20 PAK and play along, after you download this one of course!
