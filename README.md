# SquirrelPAK 20PA - Pressure Arising

With a firm foundation of Technology Arising we added PneumaticCraft for a high pressure SquirrelCraft fun!

```
We took our newly released SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising and put it in a pressure chamber then turned it up to max pressure? What exploded out? Our new mod PAK! Introducing Pressure Arising! Another PAK spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube
Â 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20PA - Pressure Arising is built upon our SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising PAK then we added the pressure of PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (by desht_08) and other supporting mods for PneumaticCraft. Conquer Minecraft by nothing but air pressure! Program your drones to deliver stuff and make other cool gadgets PneumaticCraft has to offer, all built on a vast array of tech mods that make this Network Squirrel's tail twitch with delight, maybe that was the air compressor? For the full mod list in the pack check out the Mod Pack Deps page for up to date list.

This PAK is yet another arrow in the full quiver of our MC 1.20.1 PAKS. However it's still not the highest of Tech Mods... again thats soon to come stay tuned for more!
