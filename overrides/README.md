It's here! SquirrelPAK MC20 is our PAK for the Let's Play Through series
for Minecraft v1.20 This PAK will be updated every few weeks as we add and
play through the 250 mods we will be adding. Each milestone will spawn an
other PAK. This lets us play through the all the mods! This PAK will be
updated until all the mods have been added and we have played them all!
The pack will start off at v1.0 and will be based on the
SquirrelPAK 20AV - Almost Vanilla PAK.

 
Based off of 20AV (Almost Vanilla) we already have played through enough
mods we have released 20VP (Vanilla Plus) See the mod list for up to date
