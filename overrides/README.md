# SquirrelCraft 20VP - Vainilla Plus!

```
That time again? The next installment of SquirrelCraft's release of its line of forge mod packs for 1.20 is here. Spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube
 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20VP - Almost Vanilla Plus is just what is says. SquirrelPAK 20AV PLUS some. It's Almost Vanilla Minecraft PLUS  more squirrels. Not really, I have not found a PAK that adds squirrels (YET) however what it does include is mods that I think need to be in EVERY PAK that we produce in the 1.20 line that will enhance the vanilla experience like 20AV but adds more mods that does change game play albeit in a fun way that makes SquirrelPAKs what they are, fun and always a bit nuts!

 

This PAK will be the foundation of the next few PAKS for 1.20. For the full list of mods in this PAK head to the Wiki.
