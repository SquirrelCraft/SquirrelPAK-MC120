# SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising

```
What do you get when you take the Lake of Low Tech and it rains hard with newer fresh technology? You get a Lake that Arising in Tech...Ok bad intro but whats not bad is our new PAK, introducing Technology Arising! Another PAK spawned from our LP20 PAK, the PAK from our Lets Play Series on YouTube
Â 
In this release, SquirrelPAK 20TA - Technology Arising is built upon our SquirrelPAK 20LT - Low Tech PAK then we added even more tech mods to rase the levels of Lake Tech! Mods such as Refined Storage (by raoulvdberge), RFTools (by McJty), CC: Tweaked (by SquidDev) and oh and little mod called Create (by simibubi). For the full mod list in the pack check out the Mod Pack Deps page for up to date list.

This PAK is another arrow in the quiver of our MC 1.20.1 PAKS. However it's not the highest of Tech Mods... thats soon to come stay tuned for more!
